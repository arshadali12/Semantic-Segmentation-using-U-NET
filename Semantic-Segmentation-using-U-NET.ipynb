Model Architecture and Training**\nWe will using a the **U-Net architecture** to train our semantic segmentation model. The U-Net model was named for its U-shape architecture, and it was originally created for biomedical image segmentation tasks in 2015. However, the model has become a very popular choice for other semantic segmentation tasks. \n\nU-Net builds on a previous architecture called the Fully Convolutional Network, or FCN, which replaces the dense layers found in a typical CNN with a transposed convolution layer that upsamples the feature map back to the size of the original input image, while preserving the spatial information. This is necessary because the dense layers destroy spatial information (the \"where\" of the image), which is an essential part of image segmentation tasks. An added bonus of using transpose convolutions is that the input size no longer needs to be fixed, as it does when dense layers are used. \n\nThe U-Net architecture consists of:\n\n**1. Contracting path (Encoder containing downsampling steps)**:\n\nThe contracting path follows a regular CNN architecture, with convolutional layers, their activations, and pooling layers to downsample the image and extract its features. Images are first fed through several convolutional layers which reduce height and width, while growing the number of channels. \n\nIn detail, it consists of the repeated application of two 3 x 3 unpadded convolutions, each followed by a rectified linear unit (ReLU) and a 2 x 2 max pooling operation with stride 2 for downsampling. At each downsampling step, the number of feature channels is doubled.\n\nDuring the contracting process, convolution outputs are stored in a separate variable before size reduction (pooling of features). This is passed to the expanding blocks during the decoding process as feature map.\n\n\n**2. Expanding path (Decoder containing upsampling steps)**:\n\nThe expanding path performs the opposite operation of the contracting path, growing the image back to its original size, while shrinking the channels gradually. \n\nIn detail, each step in the expanding path upsamples the feature map, followed by a 2 x 2 convolution (the transposed convolution or upsampling). This transposed convolution halves the number of feature channels, while growing the height and width of the image.\n\nNext is a concatenation with the correspondingly cropped feature map from the contracting path, and two 3 x 3 convolutions, each followed by a ReLU.\n\n\n**3. Final Feature Mapping Block**: In the final layer, a 1x1 convolution is used to map each 64-component feature vector to the desired number of classes. The channel dimensions from the previous layer correspond to the number of filters used, so when you use 1x1 convolutions, you can transform that dimension by choosing an appropriate number of 1x1 filters. When this idea is applied to the last layer, you can reduce the channel dimensions to have one layer per class. \n\nThe U-Net network has 23 convolutional layers in total. \n<center><img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/0287bZ1/U-Net.webp\" alt=\"U-Net\" border=\"0\"></center>\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### **3.1.
